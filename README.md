# 🙋‍♂️ Hi there!

I'm **Amine Zouaoui**, a student at the South Mediterranean School 🏫. I'm passionate about digital learning systems, artificial intelligence, and competitive programming 🤖. I love working on front-end web development projects and Discord bots 💻. I'm currently 19 years old 🎂 and am always looking to learn new things 🤓, particularly supervised machine learning, cloud communication, and project management.
